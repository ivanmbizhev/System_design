# System_design
System_design made by following the tutorial made by codecamp Microservice Architecture and System Design with Python &amp; Kubernetes

I followed the tuturial but there were a lot of issues as the code in the video was somewhat outdated and changes had to be made, but the core concept was very well instructed.
